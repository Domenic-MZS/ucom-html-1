This repo represents the `Exercise 2` from the Systems Analysis degree of the UCOM University HTML5 & CSS Introduction! Feel free to fork it (for any reason xD) and play with it.

There are some caveats and enhancements to be done, but this was built ASAP...
Plus this project has design/functionality limitations by the Exercise itself...
